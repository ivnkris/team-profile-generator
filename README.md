# Team Profile Generator

## Description

In this project I have created an organisational chart generator that allows the user to add a manager and multiple engineers and interns to the team using the command line. When all team members are added the application generates a styled index.html file with the team profile.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/ivnkris/team-profile-generator.git
